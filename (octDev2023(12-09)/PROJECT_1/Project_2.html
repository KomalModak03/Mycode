            <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2>
            <p><b>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was a Missile Man of India</b>. He is popularly known as the People’s
                President of
                India. His full name was Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam. He was a great scientist and 11th
                President of India. He was born in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, in a poor Tamil Muslim family on 15th of
                October in 1931 to the Jainulabudeen and Ashiamma. Kalam started supporting his family financially
                in his early age. He has completed his graduation from the St Joseph’s College, Tiruchirappalli in
                1954 and Aerospace Engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology, Chennai in 1960.

                Kalam joined the DRDO (Defense Research and Development Organization) as a scientist where he
                designed a small helicopter for the Indian Army. He also worked under Dr. Vikram Sarabhai as part of
                INCOSPAR committee. Later, he joined the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) in 1969 as
                project director of India’s first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III). Because of his
                great contributions for the development of ballistic missiles in India, he will be forever known as
                the “Missile Man of India”. The successful Pokhran-II nuclear tests of 1998 have also involved his
                important role.</p>
